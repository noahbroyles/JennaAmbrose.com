            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three men ride into Hebron, a city of refuge during the time of David's flight from Saul. One has killed a man. It is up to Eliel the scribe, and his son, Phineas, to discover the details and whether the man is deserving the shelter of the city. Was it an accident? A crime of passion? Envy? Revenge? Or Love?
